## Uisng
here i will note what am i using this is just for noting purpose after completing it i will write it in more organised way:
- While donig this i came to know of mpg123 its a simple application to run mp3 files in terminal cause i dont use linux OS (til now) so its pretty slow for getting to play mp3 files from music player so i just installed it.
- If you want you can also do it easily, from [here](https://www.mpg123.de/download.shtml) you can download file for windows 
      
     1. Download Zip file according to you system
     2. Extract that and name the folder "mpg123" move the folder into "c:\Program Files".
     3. Create a new environment variable by copy pasting the path of mpg123 into right place.
     Its just my experience it could or could not work for you.
